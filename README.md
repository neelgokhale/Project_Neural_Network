# Neural Network From Scratch

Built this to get a better grasp of the internal functions of a neural network. This is what I imagine, a rudimentary tensorflow-like package would look like (...but super rudimentary).

## Current Implementations

1. Data class
2. Neural Network class
3. Back-propagation, feed-forward, training and prediction functions
4. Sigmoid activation function
5. Clustering model, K-means generation
